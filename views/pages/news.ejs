                            <li><b>Email and Password Reset: </b>Accounts now require email verification to register. This prevents spam accounts, but users can now use it to reset their password!</li>

                            <li><b>New Teacher Panel: </b>Your student list is going to look a little different. Editting permission levels and selecting tags is now clearer and easier than before. Many of the settings have been moved to a single menu, accesible from the gear icon at the top of the page. From the Settings tab, you can now fast-edit tags, change your class name, and change the class entry code. Sounds now play in the browser on student activity.</li>
                            <li><b>Select Feature: </b>Quickly and easily poll portions of the class. The "Select" section of the panel now auto-fills with all tags students have, and all responses to polls. Now you can ask follow-up questions to only students who replied a certain way, or ask questions to only certain groups of a project.</li>
                            <li><b>Improved API: </b> Build your third party apps to integrate with Formbar. See the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/csmith1188/Formbar.js/wiki" target="_blank">Formbar.js Wiki</a> for more information.</li>
