To run Formbar.js from your local machine, follow the below steps.


# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js**: Download and install the latest version of Node from the Node.js Official Website at https://nodejs.org/.
- **Git**: If you donâ€™t have Git installed, install the latest version of Git from the Git Official Website at https://git-scm.com/.
- **Google Cloud Project**: Create a Google Cloud project for Google Oauth. There will be steps to start a Google Cloud Project of your own.

> Note: Node.js is the only required prerequisite. There will be steps to work around the other prerequisites. 

# Steps to Set Up Formbar.js

## 1. Clone the Repository
**Cloning _With_ Git**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Formbar.js.git
   ```
**Cloning _Without_ Git**
1. Navigate to Formbar.js's homepage at https://github.com/csmith1188/Formbar.js.
2. Click on `Code`.
3. Under the `Local` tab, click `Download Zip`.
4. Once the zip has finished downloading, extract the zip to your desired location.

## 2. Install Dependencies
1. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Formbar.js
   ```
2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

## 3. Setting Up Email Verification
> Note: This step is optional. It is only required for email verification. If you do not wish to use email verification, skipping this step will still allow for you to run Formbar.js locally.
1. If you have not yet, run Formbar so that the `.env` will be copied from the template, or copy the template manually and rename it to `.env`
2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and edit the following variables:

   ```env
   EMAIL_ENABLED='true'
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with:
   - **EMAIL_ENABLED**: Set this to true to enable email functionality in Formbar
   - **EMAIL_USER**: Your email address.
   - **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: Your email account password.

## 4. Seting Up Google Oauth
> Note: This step is optional. It is only required for Google Oauth. If you do not wish to use Google Oauth, skipping this step will still allow for you to run Formbar.js Locally

**Setting Up _With_ a Previous Project**
1. Go to the Google API Console at https://console.developers.google.com/
2. Select your project.
3. In your project, click `+ Enable APIs and Services`.
4. Search for and enable the Google+ API.
5. Navigate to the "Credentials" tab.
6. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID configuration.
7. Add `http://localhost:420` or the URL you wish to use for Formbar as an authorized redirect URI.

**Setting Up _Without_ a Previous Project**
1. Go to the Google API Console at https://console.developers.google.com/.
2. Create a new project.
3. In your new project, click `+ Enable APIs and Services`.
4. Search for and enable the Google+ API.
5. Set up the oauth consent screen.
6. Create Oauth credentials.
7. Add `http://localhost:420` or the URL you wish to use for Formbar as an authorized redirect URI.

1. If you have not yet, run Formbar so that the `.env` will be copied from the template, or copy the template manually and rename it to `.env`
9. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and edit the following variables:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED='true'
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=example-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=example-client_secret
   ```
   Replace the placeholders with:
   - **GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED**: Set this to true to enable Google Oauth functionality in Formbar
   - **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: Your Google Project client ID
   - **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Your Google Project client secret
   You will find the client ID and secret in your Google Oauth project.

## 5. Using the Application

**Starting**:

When in the Formbar directory in your terminal, run the following command to start the application:
   ```bash
   node app
   ```

If everything is set up correctly, the application will start running. The terminal will notify you of the port it is running on. You can access Formbar from your browser using the local server address (e.g., `http://localhost:420`).

**Closing**:

In the same terminal you started Formbar in, press Ctrl+C to close the application.

# Using Formbar Locally with Other Applications
When testing Formbar locally with other local programs, be sure to include the CORS policy headers to allow requests from Formbar.
An example of this in JS is:
```js
function createServer() {
	const app = express();
	const http = require("http").createServer(app);
	const io = require("socket.io")(http, {
		cors: {
			origin: "*",
			methods: ["GET", "POST"]
		}
	});

	return { app, io, http };
};
```

# Troubleshooting
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure you ran `npm i` in the correct directory.
- **Port Issues**: If the port you are using does not work, ensure no other application is also running on that port. The default port is `420`.
- **Incorrect .env**: If the email verification doesn't work, but you have set up your `.env` file, ensure the file's information is correct.
- **SQLITE Error**: If you receive an `SQLITE_ERROR` error, try deleting `database.db` in the `database` folder, and running `node database/init.js` in your terminal.
- **Incomplete/broken branch**: Some errors can be fixed by using the `DEV` branch, rather than `main`. You can clone the `DEV` branch using this command:
   ```bash
   git clone -b DEV --single-branch https://github.com/your-username/Formbar.js.git
   ```

Congratulations! If all these steps have been followed, Formbar.js should now run on your local machine.
