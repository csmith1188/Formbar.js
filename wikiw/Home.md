# Formbar.js
> Formbar is a classroom management tool that allows students rich and automated interaction. The core of the Formbar is access to a LED light bar or online virtual bar where information about the class can be displayed. This is normally the answer to a teacher prompt, such as a text response to a question, or a survey like poll with a multitude of possible responses. There's also a multitude of classroom management features to make teaching as fun and easy as possible.

## Features

> ## Login and Logout Page
When logging in to the Formbar, the user will be sent to a screen with three different options. Log In, New Account, and Use as Guest.

### Log In
This option shows two boxes to input your username and password to log into the Formbar. When attempting to log in, the user is also presented with a Forgot Username button. At the moment, this page does not exist, but when it is complete, we will update this wiki page to include the descriptions of its functions.

### New Account
Like the Log In page, the New Account page has two text boxes where you can input your username and password. After you have chosen them, you can click "Create Account" and be registered onto the Formbar. 

### Use as Guest
This feature is currently unavailable. When it is complete, more will be added to this section of the database.

### Creating A Class (/createclass)
When you first log in (or sign up) as a teacher, you will be greeted with a page prompting you to create a class if you do not already have one. Simply enter the name of the class into the text prompt and hit the "Create" button to create and join that class. If you have already created a class, you will see a drop down menu will all of the classes you've created so far, a button that says "Go", which will sign you into that class, and then the same prompt from before that you can use to create a new class. 

### Joining A Class (/selectclass)
When you first log in (or sign up) as a student, you will be greeted with a page prompting you to join a class. Simply enter the class code provided to you by the teacher and hit the "Submit" button to join the class.

***

> ## Home Page
After logging in, both teachers and students will see at the top of the screen 6 options: Formbar, Panel, Plugins, Leave Class, Logout, LM/DM, and only teachers can view and have access to the Manager tab.

### Home Page Options
The Formbar button will take the user to the default page for whoever the user is. Teachers will be taken to the Manager Panel, and students to the Virtual Bar (the page where you can vote can ask for bathroom breaks).

**Panel** takes teachers to the Control Panel, students without permissions will be redirected back to the Virtual Bar on click.

**Plugins** will take the user to a page with links set by the teacher to external websites.

**Leave Class** and **Logout** do what they say.

**LM/DM** switches between Light Mode and Dark Mode.

***

> ## Control Panel
The Control Panel is a page that allows the moderation of a class, creation of polls, and is only viewable with those who have permissions. It has its own mini Virtual Bar and is visible only when a poll is created. In the Control Panel you will see 4 rows of buttons; The Filter, Sort, Select, and Fast Poll.

### Rows of Buttons
**Filter** changes what students are currently visible below in the control panel depending on certain conditions. Such as if they responded to the poll or if they have any kind of ticket (Help or Bathroom).

**Sort** will organize the users within the options displayed. Such as by Name, Poll Name, Poll Time, Help Time, or their permissions.

**Select** currently does not have a function, and the buttons inside of the row do nothing.

**Fast Poll** allows the creation of polls quickly by using presets, such as TUTD (Thumbs up/Thumbs Down), True/False, Done/Ready?, Multiple Choice, and Custom.

### Tags
Tags are customizable by the teacher and can be applied to any student. They allow quick recognition of certain users, sorting, and making polls respondable to only those who have certain tags.

Tags can be set by clicking on a user at the bottom of the Control Panel. Once done you will see a tags button for the user and once clicked a screen will appear displaying all currently existing tags. By selecting the check mark besides a tag it will tie the user to that tag. 

If there are no tags or you would like to create a new one you can press **Edit Tags**, type the name of the new tag, and press **Save**. 

Or if you would like to remove a tag you would press **Edit Tags**, type in the name of an existing tag, and then **Remove Tag**.

### Custom Polls
Once you click **Custom** in the Fast Poll row, it will bring you to another page capable of creating custom polls. Enter a prompt and how many questions you want, by default questions will be given a letter if they are not given a name, and a prompt is required to star a poll.

General Options allows you to make polls Multiple Answer, accept text responses, reset the names and colors you set to default, specify tags a user/Student needs in order to respond, make the poll a Blind Poll, and have the next poll only be respondable depending on the user/Students previous poll answer.
