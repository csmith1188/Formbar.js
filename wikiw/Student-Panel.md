## Usage

If there's nothing in the class currently active, then what should display is the text "No active poll" as a default. When a class activity is created by the teacher (polls, quizzes, lessons, etc.), the text on screen will change to accommodate for that change.

### Polls

When a poll is active, there will be various things displayed on screen. 
- This will include the title of the poll, various radio buttons that you can choose between, and a submit button. 
- In order to answer the poll, the user must choose the answer they want to respond with and hit the submit button. 
- From there a pop-up should display, stating that the user's response has been submitted.

### Lessons

- When a lesson is active, it will display three headers: the Learning Goals, Daily Goals, and the Assignment for the class. 
- Under each header a variety of things related to the headers will be displayed. For example, under the Learning Goals header, there may be goals such as Nocti Prep, Javascript, and Lore of Warhammer 40K. 
- These headers and the data associated with them are created by the teacher.

### Quizzes

When a quiz is active, a variety of questions with answers underneath them will be displayed. 
- All of the answers have radio buttons which the user can select to choose their answer. 
- Once the student has completely filled out the quiz, they can hit the submit button at the bottom of the page to submit their data. 
- From there, the user is redirected to a page that displays their score. 
- The user may also access a random question by typing in the query '?question=random', which will display a random question from the quiz, or they can access a specific question by typing in the query '?question=' and then putting the number of the question in after the equals sign in the query.
