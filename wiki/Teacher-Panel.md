## Usage

- When the teacher panel is accessed, 4 buttons will be displayed: Users, Poll, Make a Lesson, and Plugins. 
- When a button is clicked, it is selected and it displays the information/prompts related to each section. Users is selected by default. 
- The class code is displayed in every section, which is what the teacher can provide to students in order to get into the class.

### Users

First, after the class code, you have class filters and sorting options. 
- You can filter by Help tickets, Break, and Polls by clicking on their respective buttons, which also provide different types of filters when you click on them multiple times. For example, with the Break filter, you can filter by who's taking a break and who's not taking a break. 
- You can sort by Name, Polls (which are the students' responses to polls), Help time (the time they sent in their help ticket), and their Permissions (used to separate bots via plugins from students). These all can be sorted by ascending and descending. 
- Under these sort and filter settings, there is a list of users logged into the class, including the teacher. 
- Under each individual user is a drop-down menu that allows the teacher to change permissions, and a Delete User button. 
- Within the drop-down menu, there are 4 options: Teacher, Bot, Student, Guest. When a student submits a help ticket, break ticket, or a poll, information related to those things will be shown under their name like: the reason for the break/help ticket, the time the tickets were submitted, and their response to the poll.
- Also under each user is a button to open a form to display that user's tags. These tags are class specific and can help when deciding who can and cannot reply to polls. Additionally, on the form, the teacher can add and remove any tags they want.
- Each student has a checkbox that can be left clicked to select that student to respond to a poll and right clicked to exclude them from the poll.

### Poll

First, after the class code, there are advanced options to create a poll, under the header "Start/End Poll". 
- These advanced options include: the amount of possible responses, if text responses are allowed, what the prompt for the poll is, what the answer names are (which is optional and in it's own menu), and if the poll is blind, meaning no one can see the results via the lights, and only the teacher panel displays the answers. 
- Lastly, the button that starts the poll is there, which starts a new poll based on the data input by the teacher. 
- When the "Change Answer Names" button is pressed, it displays under the button the color the response will be displayed as, and a text box where you input the name of the answer. 
- You can also hit the "Change Answer Names" button again (now changed to "Reset Names") to reset the names you input, allowing you to re-input the names. 
- Under the advanced options, there is another header labeled "Premade Polls:", which are default poll options you can set, which will run at the click of the respective poll option button. 
- Under that, you will find a button that allows you to view previous polls. When you click this, it will take you to a screen that displays various buttons (depending on the number of polls that have been created so far), each labeled with a date the poll was run. When you click on a poll from this menu, it will display the poll and the results associated with the poll.
- There is also a section to specify which tags are to be associated with that poll, and whether the students need those exact same tags or just to have the tags. If they have the correct tags, they can respond to the poll. If not, they will be able to see the virtual bar but cannot answer the poll.
### Make a Lesson

First, after the class code, there is a button to choose a file and another to submit the file. 
- The file the lesson is created off of is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with special formatting. An example spreadsheet is provided with Formbar.js so you won't need to create one yourself. 
- Once you submit the file, you can now hit the "Next Step" button to progress through the lesson. 
- Whenever the next step is moved to, a display box will appear, stating that the step number is active. An example of this functionality is, if Step 0 (the first step), is a poll, it will automatically create the poll based on the specifications and details in the Excel spreadsheet.

### Plugins
First, after the class code, there are two text boxes and a submit button. 
- The first text box is where the teacher can put the name of a plugin they want to access, while the second is the URL of the plugin. 
- When the teacher hits the submit button, the plugin is added to the plugins page, which can be accessed from the home screen and top menu.

### Permissions
The teacher panel features multiple dropdown boxes that allow you to change who's allowed to do what. Ex: if you want the students to be able to play games, change the "Games" permission to "Students."
