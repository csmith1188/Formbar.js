## Virtual Bar

This is a visual pie chart representation of the answers taken from polls. When you hover over each individual section, it will display the data that correlates to each answer. It also displays a key, which is used to easily identify which color in the pie chart correlates to an answer.

## Help Ticket Creation

This is primarily a feature for students to ask a teacher for help when they need it. When someone accesses this page, they are greeted with a text box and a submit button. The text box is used to input a reason as to why the student needs help so they can fully describe their issue in detail for the teacher to see. The reason is an optional part of submitting a help ticket, and is not required. The submit button submits the ticket, which will appear in the Control Panel. 

## Plugins Page

This is used for mainly students, but the teacher can also use this. This is for students to use in order to access any plugins or third-party webpages the teacher chooses. When loading the page, the student is greeted with either a variety of buttons (if there are multiple plugins), just one (if there is one plugin), or none (if there are no plugins). When you click on these buttons, it redirects you to the webpage it links to.

## Take Break

Unlike the other features, this one is purely contained within the home screen. This is used for when students wish to request a break. When you click the Take Break button, a pop-up is displayed, with the options Bathroom and Other. Bathroom is selected by default. When Other is selected, a text box appears, prompting the user to include a reason for their break (for example, going to another teacher's room for something). When the user is finished their selection, they should hit the submit button, which will send the data to the Control Panel, where the teacher will approve or deny the request.

##Checkboxes
On the teacher control panel, teachers can now select students via a checkbox next to the students' names. This allows the teachers to select individual students to be able to reply to a poll. This for in case a teacher needs to poll only a specific student or a small group of students

##Tags
Tags allow teachers the ability to sort students into different groups, such as Freshman or Senior. This allows the teacher to create polls that only certain students can answer. This allows the teacher to ask questions to a group of students, without distracting other students who aren't involved.

##Light Mode / Dark Mode
Formbar.js features a LM/DM button that changes the look of the Formbar site.
